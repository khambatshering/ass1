			<strong><em><u>Bhutanese agriculture </strong></em></u>is characterized by traditional farming practices with
low or no external inputs and dependent mainly on renewable natural
resources which are available locally. Religious sentiments in Bhutan are such
that our farmers would choose the alternative means of soil fertility
management and pest control, like use of repellents and protectants if available,
rather than the use of chemical inputs.
Developmentally, agricultural production is rapidly moving from subsistence
towards commercial farming with direct government support, both in terms
of policy as well as infrastructure development. While pursuing the
developmental goals enshrined in “Vision 2020” the Royal Government has
taken the Middle Path policy of balancing the safety of the environment and
protecting the profit of our farmers. The global trends of consumers’ preference
shifting for natural products have helped the Royal government in its decision
to initiate the organic farming program since we have the right production
environment, both physical, and socio-cultural. In our endeavour to pursue
the developmental goals, we will take advantage of our gifted physical
environment, the socio-cultural, technological and spiritual environment that
favours the development and progress of organic farming in Bhutan.

	<p>
		In agriculture, multiple cropping or multicropping is the practice of growing two or more crops in the same piece of land during one growing season instead of just one crop. When multiple crops are grown simultaneously, this is also known as intercropping. This cropping system helps farmers to double their crop productivity and income.[1] But, the selection of two or more crops for practicing multicropping mainly depends on the mutual benefit of the selected crops.

Threshing can be difficult in multiple cropping systems where crops are harvested together.[2] It can take the form of double-cropping, in which a second crop is planted after the first has been harvested. In the Garhwal Himalaya of India, a practice called baranaja involves sowing 12 or more crops on the same plot, including various types of beans, grains, and millets, and harvesting them at different times.</p>
